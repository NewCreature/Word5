Description
-----------

Word5 is a simple arcade style word guessing game. You have 5 chances to guess
the correct word and earn points. Each guess has the potential to reveal clues
about the placement of letters in the word. Use these clues to suss out the
correct word before running out of chances.

Guess as many words as you can before running out of lives. Go for a personal
best score or, optionally, compete for the highest score on the worldwide
leaderboard.


Getting Started
---------------

Use the mouse to navigate the menus. Use the keyboard to enter text where text
entry is required.


Playing the Game
----------------

The object of the game is to figure out a word by guessing. Letters in the
guess that match the letters in the word will be highlighed in red. Letters in
the guess that are in the word but not in the correct position will be
highlighted in yellow. If you do not figure out the word in five guesses, you
lose one life and a new word is selected. If you guess a word that is not
five letters or is not a real word you, lose a life but you get to keep
guessing the current word. You have five lives, once they are all gone the
game is over.
