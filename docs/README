Description
-----------

Word5 is a word guessing game similar to the GSN gameshow LINGO. Guess as many
words as you can before running out of chances. Each guessed word is worth 25
points. Go for a personal best score or, optionally, compete for the highest
score on the worldwide leaderboards.


Getting Started
---------------

Use the mouse to navigate the menus. Use the keyboard to enter text where text
entry is required.


Playing the Game
----------------

The object of the game is to figure out a word by guessing. Letters in the
guess that match the letters in the word will be highlighed in red. Letters in
the guess that are in the word but not in the correct position will be
highlighted in yellow. If you do not figure out the word in five guesses, you
lose one chance and a new word is selected. If you guess a word that is not
five letters or is not a real word you lose a chance but you get to keep
guessing the current word. You have five chances, once they are all gone the
game is over.
