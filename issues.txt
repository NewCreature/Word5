Word5 Issues
------------

v1.3.1
------

[X]Mouse coordinates don't scale or translate properly with odd window sizes.

[X]Make logo fade to/from translucent at intro/exit. Since we don't enforce a
   specific resolution, the logo can disappear suddenly if the user has set a
   weird window size.

[X]Update copyright.

[X]Update changelog.
